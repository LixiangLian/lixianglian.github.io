<td align="left"><p>The sixth generation (6G) network have recently attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia,<br /> whose vision is towards ubiquitous 3D coverage, the intelligent and green networks, Internet of everything, etc. 6G will <br /> be a combination of different networks: satellites, ocean, airplane, mobile cellular and other undefined networks to <br /> achieve seamless coverage of integrated information. Compared to the previous generations, 6G can provide services with <br /> more stringent requirement, such as high throughput, low latency, ultra reliability, denser connection, high <br /> energy efficiency, connected intelligence with machine learning capability. The requirements of 6G system have made the <br /> fine-grained optimization of radio resources and effective learning of network-related information an urgent <br /> necessity. Due to the large scale, high density, heterogeneous quality of service and integrated cross-layer and multi-<br /> function design, the optimization problem in 6G network can be extremely time-sensitive and complex, which poses great <br /> challenge for efficient optimization algorithm design. Machine learning has been recently leveraged as a disruptive <br /> technology to solve the challenging optimization problems in 6G wireless networks.  </p>
